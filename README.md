## 📋 Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- MongoDB Atlas cluster & credentials
- Firebase project with Service Account key

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

1️⃣ **Clone & Install**

```pwsh
npm install
```

2️⃣ **Configure Environment Variables**

Create a `.env` file (see `.env.example` below) and set:

- `PORT` (optional)
- `DB_USER` and `DB_PASSWORD`
- `FB_SERVICE_KEY` as a base64-encoded Firebase Service Account JSON

💡 Tip: Use `keyConvert.js` to convert your `serviceAccountKey.json` to base64:

```pwsh
node keyConvert.js > fb_key.b64
# Paste the single-line output into FB_SERVICE_KEY
```

3️⃣ **Run Locally**

```pwsh
npm run start
# or
npm run dev
```

🌐 The server starts on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or your configured PORT).

## 🔑 Environment Variables (`.env`)

```
PORT=3000
DB_USER=yourMongoUser
DB_PASSWORD=yourMongoPassword
# Base64 of Firebase Admin service account JSON
FB_SERVICE_KEY=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLC4uLg==
```

---

## 📡 API Endpoints

All JSON bodies unless noted. Authenticated routes require an Authorization header: `Bearer <Firebase ID token>`.

### 🌍 Public

- `GET /` — Health check (Welcome message)
- `GET /services` — List all services
- `GET /services/:id` — Get a service by ID

### 🔒 Authenticated

- `POST /services` — Create a service (provider metadata inferred from token)
- `GET /my-services` — List services created by the authenticated provider
- `PUT /services/:id` — Update own service
- `DELETE /services/:id` — Delete own service
- `GET /bookings/check/:serviceId/:userEmail` — Check if current user booked a service
- `POST /bookings` — Create a booking (prevents self‑booking and duplicates)
- `GET /my-bookings` — Bookings created by current user
- `GET /service-to-do` — Bookings where current user is the provider
- `PATCH /bookings/:id/status` — Provider updates booking `serviceStatus`

#### 🛡️ Notes on Auth

- Tokens are verified with Firebase Admin. The decoded token injects `req.user`.
- For `bookings` operations, the server prevents users from booking their own service and from double-booking the same service.

## 🚢 Deployment

### ▲ Vercel

This repo includes `vercel.json` configured for Node entry `index.js`.

1. Set environment variables in Vercel Project Settings:
   - `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `FB_SERVICE_KEY`, `PORT` (optional)
2. Deploy via Git integration or `vercel` CLI.

### 🍃 MongoDB

- The code expects an Atlas cluster named `RepairRight` in the connection string. Ensure your cluster/app name matches or adjust `uri` in `index.js`.

---

## 💡 Development Tips

- Use `keyConvert.js` to generate the base64 service key for `FB_SERVICE_KEY`.
- `ObjectId` is used for route params like `/services/:id` and `/bookings/:id`.
- CORS is enabled globally; configure origins in production
